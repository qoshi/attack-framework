* This is a simple attack framework for ctf T_T
** python version 2.7

** How to use this
1. in utils there are some simple get / post func for you to build a attack method quickly
2. in attack_method you can define your own attack function afther define it put it into methods array
3. config something in config.py such as sumit ip, noobs' ip and so on
4. run main.py
5. you do not need restart the server after you define a new attack method, it will automatically load the new func in next 30 seconds round.
6. valid flags will be saved in config.flag_log_path
7. attack log will be saved in config.req_log_path

** TBD
1. use reg to detect service log to attack backT_T
